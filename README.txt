This repository contains my solutions to John Crickett's Coding Challenges. The
challenges are available at https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro.

Unlike other similar repos, I plan on solving these challenges using more
obscure languages (and I hope I'll stick to this plan). If you want to see
TypeScript or Python, you got repos like this a dime a dozen.

This started as me finding the website after wanting to make an IRC client, but
soon I realized other challenges were just as interesting for me.

With that being said, you can find more information under each challenge's
directory.
